Hi there. I'm Philip. Would you like to look at some code that I write? In that case you're in the right place. The table below showcases some projects I have written or contributed to.

| Title | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| [MNIST experiment from Tensorizing neural networks (Novikov et al. 2015)](https://github.com/philip-bl/tensorizing_neural_networks-novikov_2015) | This is a replication of the MNIST experiment from [Tensorizing Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06569). The author achieves a good result on MNIST without convolutional layers. The implementation of matrix tensor train layer in this repo is not very reusable, but itâ€™s very simple to understand! |
| [Deep Convolutional Tensor Network](https://github.com/philip-bl/dctn) | This repository contains the experiments I used in my paper [Deep Convolutional Tensor Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14506) presented at 2020 NeurIPS Quantum Tensor Networks in Machine Learning Workshop. In the paper, I study a novel hybrid neural network / tensor network machine learning model. |
| [GPT-2 Chatbot](https://github.com/philip-bl/gpt2_chatbot) | This was a student group project at Skoltech. We fine-tuned GPT-2 on dialog corpora (this was before ChatGPT), built a chatbot and launched it on Telegram. |
| [Tensor Train Decomposition for Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/philip-bl/tensor_train_rnn) | This was a student group project at Skoltech. I replicated an experiment from [Tensor-Train Recurrent Neural Networks for Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01786) (while accidentally getting SOTA results). [My contributed code](https://github.com/philip-bl/tensor_train_rnn/tree/master/ytcelebfaces), [Report describing the experiments](https://github.com/philip-bl/tensor_train_rnn/blob/master/report.pdf) |
| [Bayesian Tensorized Neural Networks with Automatic Rank Selection](https://github.com/vicontek/lrbtnn) | Another student group project where we replicated [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10478) but failed to obtain the same results. |
| [libcrap](https://bitbucket.org/nemelex/libcrap/src/master/) | A small python library with a bunch of useful code written by me and used in many of my projects. |
